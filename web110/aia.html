It's important for his customers to be able to easily navigate throughout his site, in and out of pages using the navigation menu when appropriate. He would also like the "Appraisal Kit" form to be located on the majority of his site pages.</td>

        <p>By segmenting investors and collectors of gold and silver coins, we were able to generate quantitative and qualitative data, which I was then able to use to optimize Mr.Batemans website for performance and user accessibility.</p>

      <td><h3>Loan Equity</h3>
                <p>Developing a strategy to market this website to people that are looking for a loan, the same way a bank would, I believe will attract the right people looking for this service. Those who work 8 to 10 hour work days who are still having trouble paying their bills may think this service is helpful. Looking back on better financial times would give them a chance to turn some of their jewelry into cash that can be used today.</p>

          <p>Marketing this website to those that are elderly in age is a demographic that will be looking for this service in order to sell their gold for cash. Adults 65 years of age and up have shown to use the internet about 1.5 times more,(when purchasing goods) then those adults in their 40's,"The largest proportion of people buying online once or twice is found among those aged 55-74 (39 %)"-EUROPEAN STATISTICS, https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/. Also those 65 and up are using the internet more and more each year as they become accustomed to it.</p>
