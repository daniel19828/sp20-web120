<h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
<p>The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement shall be binding for every customer of Pacific Northwest Gold Buyers, Inc. By shipping your goods to Pacific Northwest Gold Buyers, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “PacnwGB”), you are agreeing to all terms and conditions herein.</p>
<h4>Requirements for Use</h4>
<p>Customers must be at least eighteen (18) years of age and the actual legal owner of any gold, jewelry, precious metals or other property sold or attempted to be sold to PacnwGB. Every customer must be acting on his or her own behalf and not as the agent or representative of another person. PacnwGB may, but shall not be obligated or required to, request documentation or other proof of compliance with the requirements contained in this paragraph.</p>
        <h4>Guarantee Against Loss</h4>
<p>PacnwGB will guarantee against loss of any package properly shipped to PacnwGB in accordance with its established instructions and procedures and subject to the terms and conditions described herein. Due to fraud PacnwGB cant be liable if packages come to us and are empty or missing contents since we have no way of knowing if they were tampered or emptied before shipping in order to try and claim some type of insurance. Our insurance only covers packages that have been scanned into the Fedex system and were lost in transit. PacnwGB reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject delivery of any mail, envelope or package which appears to be damaged, opened, or tampered with, and to return such mail, envelope or package to the customer. PacnwGB shall have no liability to any customer for any such attempted delivery or return of such items.</p>
        <h4>Insurance Coverage Requirements</h4>
<p>For an insurance claim to be valid, proof of value and purchase is required, such as original purchase receipt, and the package(s) must be picked up by FedEx or dropped off at a staffed Fed Ex location. This is to ensure packages can be inspected before being shipped. Pacific Northwest Gold Buyers is not responsible for packages that are dropped off at drop-boxes or for items packaged in non-FedEx packaging, as we cannot guarantee durability. For your convenience, we provide you with a list of FedEx Authorized Ship centers near you. You must obtain a FedEx receipt, as that is your proof of drop-off, and hold onto it until your transaction with us is complete.
For contents valued over $5,000.00 we suggest that you double-box the shipment for added security. All Fed Ex boxes are free to use when using our prepaid labels. For example, place your contents in a small FedEx box and then place that box in a Medium FedEx box. It is recommended that you do not disclose the contents of the package to any FedEx employees. Please contact customer support at 206-681-7714 if you have any questions concerning shipments.
If you believe your gold jewelry or other property is worth more than $5,000.00, please call customer support and ask for an increase in insurance. We also strongly advise that you list the contents of your Kit on the Customer Information Card included with the Appraisal Kit, which you must return to us.</p>
        <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
<p>This limitation of liability shall be binding on every customer and any third party, including but not limited to the customer and the customer’s successors, assigners, insurance carriers and other individuals or entities asserting any right or claim relating to the customer’s transaction with PacnwGB. PacnwGB liability is and shall be expressly and specifically limited to the LEAST of the following sums:
* The liquidation value placed on the total contents by PacnwGB in its sole discretion.
* One-third (1/3) of the appraised value of the contents according to an appraisal submitted by a customer/seller to PacnwGB, which appraisal was issued prior to the shipment of the item to PacnwGB
* The sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00)
The customer/seller expressly acknowledges and agrees that if there is no appraisal which was issued prior to the contents begin submitted to PacnwGB, PacnwGB’s liquidated value shall be conclusive and binding; and further, that in no event shall PacnwGB’s Liability exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00).
PacnwGB shall not be liable to anyone for any damages, including but not limited to: incidental, consequential, punitive, loss of profit or opportunity, other than as set forth herein above. By submitting the items, the customer explicitly and expressly accepts this limitation of liability. 
        <h4>Verbal Offers</h4>
<p>Any customer or prospective seller may request PacnwGB to provide a telephone or e-mail quote for his or her items after such items have arrived at PacnwGB’s processing facility. Verbal offers may be recorded at the sole discretion of PacnwGB. Upon a verbal acceptance by the customer of the telephone or e-mail quote, payment will be issued by PacnwGB within twenty-four (24) hours of such acceptance.</p>
        <h4>Affiliates</h4>
<p>PacnwGB has several affiliates that provide information on our service and refer website visitors to us. Affiliates must adhere to rules and guidelines set forth by our program to maintain ethical advertising practices and remain in our affiliate programs, but ultimately we do not have control over affiliate websites (affiliates not following our terms and conditions are subject to cancellation).</p>
        <h4>Gold Chart Disclaimer of Liability</h4>
<p>PacnwGB shall not be responsible for the contents of the gold chart data appearing on its website. These charts are prepared by third parties other than PacnwGB and are included only for general information to its customers. PacnwGB shall not be liable to anyone who relies on the information contained therein.</p>
        <h4>Return Insurance Liabilities</h4>
<p>If an item is returned to a customer, PacnwGB will insure the item for no more than the amount offered by PacnwGB, regardless of what it was insured for when mailed by the customer to PacnwGB, unless PacnwGB is otherwise notified by the customer via email or fax prior to the return shipment and the customer agrees to pay for the extra insurance requested. PacnwGB shall, in its sole discretion, choose the return carrier, insurance and receipt verification method for each transaction.</p>
        <h4>Choice of Law, Waiver, and Claims</h4>
        <p>The Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of law provisions. PacnwGB’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not be deemed to be a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. You agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the services offered by PacnwGB must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Any such claim or cause of action must be filed in the State of Washington. PacnwGB shall be entitled to reimbursement for all costs incurred by it in defending any civil action filed or attempted to be filed in any jurisdiction outside of the State of Washington, including but not limited to attorney’s.</p>

<p>If you are not 100% satisfied with our offer, you must deny the offer by email at pacificnorthwestgoldbuyers@gmail.com within 72 hours of receipt of the offer. PacnwGB will return ship your merchandise free of charge and insure it for the amount that was offered by PacnwGB.</p>
        <h4>Bonus Offers</h4>
<p>Bonus offers do not apply on bullion, coins or bars or diamonds, or an any special phone pricing. Bonus offers may not be combined with any other offers or promotions.</p>
        <h4>Price Match Guarantee</h4>

        <h4>Unanswered Offers</h4>
<p>Customers are required to accept or deny an offer from PacnwGB within SEVENTY-TWO (72) HOURS of the offer being made. If PacnwGB has received no response to its offer after 72 hours, it will send the customer a check in the amount of the original offer. PacnwGB will hold the items in question for no more than THIRTY (30) DAYS, or until the check is cashed, whichever occurs first. This time limit cannot be waived or extended for any reason, and PacnwGB will not be responsible for any loss or damage of any kind if the time limit is not followed.</p>
        <h4>Waiting Period for a Claim</h4>
<p>A customer who wishes to submit a claim to PacnwGB must NOTIFY THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY TO REQUEST A CLAIM FORM. To be processed, the claim form must be fully and accurately completed, signed and mailed to Pacific Northwest Gold Buyers, Inc. in accordance with the claim form instructions. The customer must submit all supporting documentation with the completed and signed claim form. Failure to properly complete, sign and/or mail the claim form WITH PROOF THAT THE GOODS WERE MAILED to PacnwGB will result in the denial of the claim by PacnwGB.
